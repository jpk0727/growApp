                <h4> For our senior design project, we are building an aeroponic growing environment prototype that aims at providing a sustainable means of growing food in an indoor setting. We are interested in learning about and developing the future of indoor sustainable farming because we believe it could be a solution to many food related issues our world is facing. Land is becoming more limited and urban populations increase, so we wanted use are engineering and agricultural knowhow to work toward a solution to the critical issue of food scarcity. A central component of our system is the aeroponic misters as a means of watering the crops. We chose this watering technique because it strikes an optimal balance between providing the roots with oxygen while maintaining sufficient water levels. Aeroponics also helps to mitigate algae buildup. We monitor environmental parameters such as humidity, temperature, water utilization, amount of light, and spectrum of light to understand the conditions in which our crops are growing. These variables will also help us optimize the growing environment over time to maximize food production. Our system uses a computer to control the water pump, water valves, fans, and lights through network connectivity. The operating system for our device will record both input and output data in on database hosted on a remote database. This will allow us to look at long term trends in our crops and inform us on how to tune the environment parameters to maximize production. We are excited to work on a project that will give us the opportunity to think about the major problem of food scarcity that our world faces and engineer a prototype that brings us one step closer to solving this issue. This project is being advised by Nelson Macken and Carr Everbach in the Engineering Department and is funded by the Swarthmore Engineering Department.

                <p>Jess grew up in Dallas and Boston and currently studying engineering and compter science at Swarthmore College. Jess spends his time at swat in the campus garden, improving swarthmore sustainability initiatives, and researching optics. Jess is passionate about agricultural technology and finding solutions to issues of water polution, food scarcity and food insecurity. He enjoys working on a farm just as much as solving complicated issues in technology.</p>

                </h3>
                <p>Connie hails from New Jersey and is currently completing an engineering degree at Swarthmore College. At Swat, she co-captains the lacrosse team and co-manages the campus garden. She has experience researching living walls, designing and constructing a greenhouse, coaching, farming and working as a pastry chef. (and along the way she's learned occasionally useful skills such as goat-milking, breadstick-making and high-speed-harvesting).  She is passionate about sustainable food production and distribution and hopes to use entrepreneurship to improve some element of the global food chain.</p>
